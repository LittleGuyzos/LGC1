Changelog

Version 1.2.2 (Jun 10, 2018):
  -(Blind Devil) Fixed Star.asm, which didn't have a bank wrapper, thus not
   reading tables correctly.
  -(Blind Devil) Fixed sa1def.asm, uncommenting the !7FAB64 define macro
   (Extra Byte 4), and also correcting the default SA-1 address of
   !extra_byte_4, used by the tool, which was wrong (default was $4000D8
   when the correct is $4000DB).

Version 1.2.1 (Jan 17, 2018):
  -(RPG Hacker) Added a changelog so that we don't have to search all over the
   internet for things that have changed between versions.
   (Note that information on versions prior to this one may be inaccurate)
  -(RPG Hacker) Added missing command line arguments to Readme.
  -(Blind Devil) Fixed SubOffScren.asm.
  -(LX5) Fixed some extended sprites defines having wrong RAM addresses.

Version 1.2 (Dec 04, 2017):
 (Information on this version added post-released by RPG Hacker, may not be accurate,
 feel free to fix any mistakes and add any missing information)
  -Added support for JSON configuration file (with CFG files still supported for
   backwards-compatibility).
  -Added functionality to generate .ssc, .mwt, .mw2 and .s16 files from information
   embedded into the JSON sprite configuration files.
   (Those files are used by Lunar Magic for displaying sprites more nicelys in the editor)
  -Updated the CFG Editor so that it actually lets you edit said embedded information
   in the JSON files via a more intuitive GUI, inspired by Lunar Magic's interface.
  -Added -npl option to disable per-level sprites. This is primarily intended as a
   workaround for Asar's "freedata align" freezing bug.
   NOTE: Do not use on ROMs with sprites already inserted into slots B0 to BF.
  -Added -a <asm> option to override the asm path PIXI uses.
  -Improved handling for when the ROM isn't in the same folder as PIXI by converting paths
   to either relative to the ROM or relative to the executable.

Version 1.1 (Jul 29, 2017):
 (Information on this version added post-released by RPG Hacker, may not be accurate,
 feel free to fix any mistakes and add any missing information)
  -Added support for cluster sprites.
  -Added support for extended sprite.
  -Added support for up to 4 extra bytes per sprite that can be set via Lunar Magic.
  -Renamed and added new command line options for customizing the paths PIXI uses.
  -Updated CFG Editor, which now contains all the functionality of Tweaker.
  -(RPG Hacker; Aug 22, 2017) Fixed a couple of bugs in different included ASM files,
   mainly in regards to SA-1 compatibility.
