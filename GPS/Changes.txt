Should be 10 items total in case if a file is missing.

Updates:
 5/7/2018 (V1.3.1) (TheBiob)
  - Fixed a bug with descriptions not working if there was a block between two with the same file name
  - Fixed GPS breaking 6MB+ SA-1 ROMS because Asar doesn't fully support full sa1 roms yet
  - Fixed rainbow_shatter_block.asm breaking on non-SA-1 due to a falsely put !bank8
  - teleport.asm now sets the "exit exists" flag automatically. A bit slower in most cases but more true to what the description says it does.
  - Added new standard routines
    - layer2_sprite_position.asm ; Gets the actual sprite position even if the block is placed on layer 2
 10/16/2017 (V1.3.0) (TheBiob)
  - Now supports Lunar Magic's new Map16 pages (Pages 40+)
  - Added "@dsc" command to the list file
  - Added new standard routines
    - swap_XY.asm
    - move_spawn_relative.asm
    - check_sprite_kicked_vertical.asm
    - check_sprite_kicked_horizontal.asm
    - spawn_sprite_block.asm
  - Updated routines
    - change_map16.asm (Faster and smaller version, Akaginite)
    - spawn_bounce_sprite (Now allows for usage with the Bounce Block Unrestrictor and/or Custom Bounce Blocks, MarioFanGamer) (Read the comments in the asm file for more information)
  - (Officially) Added ways to assign the same file and acts like to multiple blocks in one line
  - GPS now uses asar 1.50's dll
  - List file now supports comments (; at the beginning of a line)
  - Added additional information in block_clean.asm telling you what it's cleaning (This was mainly used for debugging but I figured someone might find this useful so I left it in)
  - Fixed a minor bug which no one noticed since it's something no one would ever do so I'm not sure why I mention it here (You were forced to put JMP after db $37 for it to work which is now fixed)

  3/15/2017 (V1.2.31) (TheBiob)
  - Added another overlooked offset to db $37

 3/11/2017 (V1.2.3) (TheBiob)
  - Added a new header (db $37) which allows a block to use the new Wallrun offset

 2/27/2017 (V1.2.2) (GHB)
  - Was removed because the new offset was not optional causing all current blocks to be incompatible.

 2/8/2017 (V1.2.1) (GHB)
  - Fix a bug where spriteH may not execute block codes when embedded deeply in the block. This can be
    proven by having a block act like $130 via Lunar magic, but have spriteH and spriteV both run this code:
     ;----code----;
      LDY #$00
      LDA #$25
      STA $1693
     ;----end_code----;
    which causes the sprites (mostly dropped sprites, like shells) to be pushed out. Therefore, the block
    partially behaves $025. This works the other way around too: $025 by Lunar Magic, behaves $130 with
    block codes and the blocks fail to push sprites outward.

  - Added another block offset: MarioWallRun.
