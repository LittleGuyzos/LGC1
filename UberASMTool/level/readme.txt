Just a note that the ASM/CFG files in the 'generator version' folder are an alternative to the UberASMTool version.
You don't require to use both at the same time. You should use ONE or ANOTHER, actually.

The generator version is meant to be inserted with PIXI, and it exists for the oldbies who prefer using generators
in very specific places and circumstances.
